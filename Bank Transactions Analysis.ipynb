    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Huduma Bank has been in operation for 5 years. Although the bank has experienced a steady increase in its user base, Huduma Bank executives feel it is time to refine its business model by closely observing and analyzing transaction trends related to its customers. Recently, the bank has become more focused on collecting transaction data, resulting in a dataset that spans the past 3 months. While this data does not cover its entire operational period, the bank hopes that it will provide sufficient insights to guide decisions. Their goal is to identify key areas for improvement and focus that will support the implementation of strategic objectives to drive growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "By contracting a data analyst, the bank wishes to achieve the following objectives:\n",
    "- **Highlight Data Quality Challenges:** Address potential issues that may impact the accuracy of any analysis.\n",
    "- **Examine Transaction Patterns:** Evaluate transaction data to uncover trends in customer behaviour.\n",
    "- **Identify Operational Opportunities:** Determine which aspects of its current service offerings may be optimized to better support its revenue model.\n",
    "\n",
    "By gathering and analysing these insights, Huduma Bank aims to make informed strategic decisions to enhance customer engagement, improve service delivery, and drive sustainable growth.\n"

    "\n",
    "### Data Description  \n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, I will be using the transaction dataset provided by Huduma Bank. The dataset contains transaction records collected between September and November 2018, capturing various customer transaction activities over that period. The data is organized into several fields, each representing a different aspect of a transaction as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **status:** Indicates the current state of the transaction (e.g., \"authorised\" or \"posted\").\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **card_present_flag:** A binary indicator showing whether the card was physically present during the transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **txn_description:** Describes the type or channel of the transaction (such as POS, SALES POS, PAYMENT, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **first_name:** The first name of the customer involved in the transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **balance:** The account balance at the time the transaction was recorded.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **date:** The date when the transaction occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **gender:** The gender of the customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **age:** The age of the customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **merchant_suburb:** The suburb where the merchant is located.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **merchant_state:** The state in which the transaction took place.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **amount:** The monetary value of the transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **movement:** Indicates whether the transaction is a debit or a credit.\n",

    "### Data Quality Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "During my review of the dataset, I identified several data quality issues that could impact the accuracy and clarity of the analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lack of a data dictionary:**\n",
    "Without a detailed data dictionary, it is challenging to fully understand the context and intended meaning of each field, especially for binary or categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inconsistent naming conventions:**\n",
    "Both `SALES POS` and `POS` are present in the dataset. It was difficult to understand whether they referred to the same type of transaction or not. If so, standardizing these into a single, consistent label would help prevent ambiguity during analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Missing values in non-POS transactions:**\n",
    "Transactions classified as `POS` have missing values in the fields: `card_present_flag`, `merchant_suburb`, and` merchant_state`. This is likely because these details are only relevant to POS transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limited customer identification:**\n",
    "Only first names are provided for customers, which makes it difficult to differentiate customers with similar names. This introduces the risk of combining transaction values from distinct customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**No unique transaction identifiers:**\n",
    "There is currently no field that helps to uniquely identify each transaction, which can pose an issue when we want to reference a specific transaction."

    "## Data Cleaning and Transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure that my analysis is based on more accurate and reliable data, I did some data cleaning to address some of the data issues identified above.\n",
    "\n",
    "**a) POS vs SALES POS:**\n",
    "\n",
    "After conducting exploratory analysis comparing the 'POS' and 'SALES POS' labels across attributes such as transaction movement, geographic location (state), and card presence, I did not observe any significant differences that would suggest they represent distinct transaction types. I therefore decided to have both represented by a single category label, 'POS', for consistency and clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Process:**\n",
    "\n",
    " [insert picture]\n",
    "`=IF(OR([@[txn_description]]=\"POS\", [@[txn_description]]=\"SALES-POS\"), \"POS\", [@[txn_description]])`\n",
    "\n",
    "I used the above formula to perform the calculation in a separate column, and then copied the resulting values back into the original column to update the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**b) Missing values:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the nature of the missing values, I saw it fit to replace blanks in the `card_present_flag`, `merchant_state`, and `merchant_suburb` columns with \"N/A\" to indicate that the data isn't applicable for those transaction types. This way, these missing values will not be mistaken for errors. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Process:**\n",
    "\n",
    "`=IF(ISBLANK([@[card_present_flag]]), \"N/A\", [@[card_present_flag]])`\n",
    "\n",
    "I applied this formula in a separate helper column and then copied the resulting values back into the original column. The same process was repeated for the `merchant_state` and `merchant_suburb` columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**c) Customer Identifier Issue:**\n",
    "\n",
    "To address the issue of customer identification, I decided to create a composite key by combining multiple fields available in the dataset. This composite key allows us to approximate a unique identifier for each customer, improving the integrity of customer-level analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Process:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, I concatenated the `first_name`, `gender`, and `age` fields into a new column,  `CompositeID` using the formula: `=[@[first_name]] & \"_\" & [@gender] & \"_\" & [@age]. For example, a record with first_name \"John\", gender \"M\", and age \"35\" is represented as \"John_M_35\"`. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The risk of misidentification still remains if multiple customers share identical values in the chosen fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "**d) Data type adjustments:**\n",
    "\n",
    "-Since `card_present_flag` is a categorical variable and now includes the non-numeric value `N/A`, I converted its data type to text. This ensures consistency with the pre-existing binary categorical values (`1` and `0`) - which had been processed as numeric.\n",
    "\n",
    "-I also converted the `date` column to a date data type for any time-based analyses and date operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can explore the clean version of the dataset reflecting the mentioned changes on the `Clean version` worksheet of project Excel workbook [link]."

    "I created a pivot table summarizing the transaction count and total transaction value by age group. I then created column charts for visual representation, which also form part of the dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data shows that the younger age groups (`16–25`, `26–37`, and `38–47`) drive the highest transaction counts and the largest total transaction values among Huduma’s customers. Meanwhile, older age groups (48 and above) show significantly lower activity levels, both in terms of transaction volume and overall spending.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Insights and Recommendations**\n",
    "\n",
    "The domination by younger customers implies that Huduma’s offerings, marketing, or digital infrastructure may resonate well with younger demographics. Less activity from older age groups could suggest a smaller customer base in those brackets or different banking behaviour or preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these findings, the bank can choose to focus on the needs of the highly active younger demographic while also making an effort to introduce initiatives that may appeal to older customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "They should invest more in digital innovation such as mobile apps, online platforms, and other tech-driven solutions that align with younger customers’ preferences. They can also look into student banking solutions.\n",
    "At the same time, the bank can provide targeted workshops or tutorials to build confidence in digital banking for older age brackets. While still ensuring that their banking options remain robust for customers who prefer more traditional or offline banking methods."

    "### Transaction Analysis by Type and Movement\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pivot table and Visualisation/ Observation**\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose to combine transaction analysis by type and movement because they complement each other and tell a unified story about the nature of transactions highlighted in our dataset. We are able to see the transaction data of each type along with its underlying movement pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "I created two pivot tables: one pivot table summarizes the count of transactions by type and movement (debit vs. credit), while another aggregates the total transaction value for each combination of transaction type and movement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the pivot tables, I created two stacked bar charts to communicate the same information visually.\n",
    "\n",
    "I observed that `POS` transactions lead in volume with a count of `7,717`, making them the most frequent type. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although `PAY/SALARY` transactions are fewer, they drive the highest total transaction value (`over 1.6 million`), which is expected given that salaries represent less frequent lump-sum deposits. \n",
    "\n",
    "`Phone Banking` seems to be the least used type of transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "When looking at movement, I initially noted that `debit` transactions are far more frequent than `credits`. This became clearer after breaking down by transaction type where I observed that all credit transactions are tied to salary deposits only while all other transactions types are deposits.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Insights and Recommendations**\n",
    "\n",
    "The high volume of `debit` transactions, particularly via `POS`, indicates that the bank’s infrastructure is well-aligned with day-to-day retail payments. The bank can reinforce this pre-existing popularity by ensuring that its `POS` and other `debit` channels continue to operate efficiently and enhance the customers’ experience through loyalty programs. They should also focus on optimizing fee structures to capitalize on the high volume of `POS` transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The high-value `credit` transactions from `PAY/SALARY` show that the bank offers an appeal for salary deposits. This presents an opportunity that can be leveraged for additional revenue. For instance, the bank can encourage more people to consider them for salary deposits through promotions and partnerships with employers. They can also develop relevant complementary financial products, such as tailored savings, credit, or investment plans.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notably low adoption of `Phone Banking` is surprising given the bank’s predominantly younger customer base, who would typically be inclined toward digital solutions. This points to a potential gap in digital engagement that might be addressed with improved user experiences and targeted marketing campaigns."

    "I created a pivot table summarizing the transaction count and total transaction value by status. I then decided to keep only the information on transaction count for the visualisation as the goal is to find out how many transactions are `authorized` vs `posted`.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Insights and Recommendations**\n",
    "\n",
    "This observation indicates a common phenomenon in banking environments where `POS` transactions are first `authorized` on the spot to confirm available funds and are then `posted` after a certain period, probably a day or two. However, given our data spans three months, it’s unusual to see so many POS transactions still in the authorized state for such long periods, suggesting **potential delays**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This situation is probably caused by **operational bottlenecks** or an **error in the bank’s system** that could be keeping transactions in the authorized state longer than expected.\n",
    "Otherwise, it may reflect a **data anomaly** rather than an actual real-world delay.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bank should first confirm whether the data accurately captures status updates. If not, the data flow should be improved to ensure that the **data reflects the change in status** once transactions are posted.\n",
