This project explores synthesized transaction data from Huduma Bank, a hypothetical financial institution. The goal was to analyze transaction trends, identify business insights, and recommend strategies to refine the bank’s business model.

## Objectives

- Identify data quality issues that may affect analysis.

- Understand customer transaction patterns across gender, age, type, and channel.

- Recommend strategic and operational improvements for the bank.

- Practice real-world Excel data analysis and dashboarding for business decision-making.

- Phone Banking is underused → potential digital engagement gap.

- Status delays in POS transactions → possible operational or data issues.

## Recommendations Summary

- Strengthen POS channels and reward frequent usage.

- Capitalize on salary deposits with complementary products.

- Renovate phone banking experience and promotion.

- Address data quality issues to support better analysis and decision-making.

- Continue scaling through a retail banking model driven by transaction volume.
